         (git push <remote-name> <branch-name> )
->git checkout -b mybranch(to switch to another branch)
->git push <remote_name> --delete <branch_name>(to delete branch e.g git push origin --delete mynewbranch)
-> git checkout master(switch back to master branch)
->git branch -a (to list all remote branches)
