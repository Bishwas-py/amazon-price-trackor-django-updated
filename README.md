Amazon Price tracker using **Python, Django Framework, SQLite, Celery Task Queue and Scrapy Framework**. Frontend is developed using **HTML,CSS, and Bootstrap**

TRACKASS (Amazon Price Tracker) keeps track of amazon product user want to purchase at a particular price, when price drops to a specified price it **notifies the user via registered email.**
it helps users to **save time** as they don't need to manually open the amazon.in and check drop in price every day, they just need to ***copy the URL of product*** and ***add to tracker***, as soon as price drops user gets notified and can buy product before everyone else does and ***before product gets out of stock***, user can add unlimited products from amazon.in for which he/she wants to track the price.
